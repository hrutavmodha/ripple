# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge
We as members, contributors, and maintainers pledge to make participation in this
project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size,
visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity
and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality,
personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Taking responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes
- Focusing on what is best for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others’ private information without permission
- Any conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response
to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments,
commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned
with this Code of Conduct.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and also applies when an
individual is officially representing the project in public spaces. Examples of
representing a project include using an official project email address, posting via
an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an
online or offline event.

## Reporting
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported
to the project maintainers via our community Discord server at https://discord.gg/JBF2ySrh2W.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

## Enforcement
Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith
may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the
project’s leadership.
