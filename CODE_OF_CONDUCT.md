# Code of Conduct

This project is built by people who want to create something cool together. Let's
keep it fun, welcoming, focused, and worth everyone's time.

### Do

- **Be respectful** — Treat everyone with kindness. We're all here because we care
  about the project.
- **Bring real value** — Make contributions that help the project move forward:
  thoughtful code, clear docs, useful bug reports, or constructive ideas. When
  submitting pull requests, focus on solving real problems or improving things for
  users/maintainers—not just adding your name to the contributors list. Small,
  high-quality changes beat big, low-effort ones every time.
- **Own your code** — If you're using AI tools to help write or suggest code,
  review it carefully, understand it fully, test it, and make it your own.
  Unreviewed or barely-touched AI output is just noise—don't spam the project with
  it.
- **Stay on topic** — Keep discussions, issues, and PRs related to the project.
  Save off-topic stuff for somewhere else.
- **Give constructive feedback** — Point out problems kindly and suggest fixes
  when you can. We're all learning.
- **Assume good intent** — People usually mean well. If something feels off, ask
  for clarification before assuming the worst.
- **Have fun and be excellent to each other** — Celebrate wins, thank people, and
  enjoy the ride.

### Don't

- **Spam** — No drive-by comments, promo links, unrelated noise, or low-effort PRs
  (including untouched AI-generated ones).
- **Harass or attack** — No insults, slurs, threats, personal attacks, or
  unwelcome advances. Ever.
- **Troll** — Don't derail conversations or pick fights.
- **Push big drama** — If there's conflict, try to resolve it privately or with a
  maintainer first.

### If something goes wrong

If you see behavior that breaks these guidelines, or you feel uncomfortable, reach
out on Discord: https://discord.gg/JBF2ySrh2W. We'll listen, handle it fairly, and
keep things confidential if needed. Maintainers can warn, remove comments/PRs, or
ban repeat offenders.

Thanks for helping make this a great place to collaborate. Let's build something
awesome together!
